# Learning Outcomes
1. General understanding of the Microsoft Library business, vision, and strategic plans; Overview of MS Library operations; Overview of Microsoft Archives operations, strategies, and workflows; Develop understanding of corporate library value to employees and the organization.
2. Through hands on experience working with Microsoft Archives develop an understanding of heritage and history in corporate settings through an archival practice.
3. Create Expert Insights Playbook using third party research that will provide guidance for sharing targeted insights for Microsoft's strategic and cultural objectives. The goal will be to understand the business and market context and how the ProResearch team uses this content to analyze the needs of the company and employees. This will also allow for and understanding into how a centralized research service meets the needs of a multi-national corporation with a diverse product line and customer base.
4. Learn about and gain experience with employee engagement, collection development, material curation, and assessing audience needs.
5. Assist with UX/Usability Study of Library portal to understand and gain experience in user experience studies, conducting interviews, and interpreting findings for action and measurable improvement of the MS Library portal.

# Weekly Learnings
My weekly activities and learnings will be tracked in two ways:

An Excel sheet where I will track my daily time spent and summary of activities along with a PowerPoint deck that will be updated weekly where I will summarize my weekly 
learnings and how I contributed to my projects/deliverables. My PowerPower deck will also include a summary slide that details my Archives project. On my Sway page, I will also include a weekly personal blog reflection.

# Projects
Deliverables included:
        
        Evidence of UX Study: including notes of findings/white paper outlining outcomes along with three personas based on study findings.
        
        Expert Insights Playbook: Market Research project that includes outline for future work (draft uploaded each week to show progress) that shows evidence of
        research around topic areas that are important to Microsoft and library customers and knowledge of event planning and implementation.
        
        Studios Migration Digital Archive Project: Excel sheet uploaded each week to show progress but this sheet will ultimately be removed as it contains
        sensitive/confidential information about Microsoft that cannot be on a public facing website; PowerPoint deck will contain a summary slide about the project 
        with totals calculated of videos reviewed and GB of duplicate material removed from collection.
